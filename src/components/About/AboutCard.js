            Mental health is just as important as physical health. It is crucial to take care of our emotional and psychological well-being. 
            Regular self-assessments can help us understand our mental state, recognize signs of stress or depression, 
            and take steps to improve our quality of life. 
            Thatâ€™s why we encourage you to complete this questionnaire and reflect on your own well-being. 
            By becoming more aware of your mental health, you can make informed choices to take better care of yourself.
